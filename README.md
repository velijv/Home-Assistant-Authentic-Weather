# Home-Assistant-Authentic-Weather
[Authentic Weather](https://www.awwwards.com/authentic-weather-probably-the-most-honest-weather-app.html) phrases to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) as a sensor and a script for TTS to smart speakers. 

- **phrases.json** - the original wordings by Authentic Weather creators for reference\
- **authentic-weather-sensor.yaml** - a sensor based on Dark Sky icon state\
- **authentic-weather-script.yaml** - a script for text-to-speech to say the current Authentic Weather state out loud. 

To make it work in Google Assistant, make sure you have "**script**" as an exposed domain, or make this particular script exposed to your Google Assistant integration. 

Then you can make a routine to ask "What's the f*cking weather?" to run the script as "Activate Authentic Weather" - which will reply the current weather state, like  `Get your fucking umbrella.` when it's raining.
